# hello-world
More specifically, hello GitHub!

I'm a physics PhD student currently, writing my thesis and learning GitHub as I wish to move into software development. I'll put some projects up here in Python, my academic work once it's ready and some other projects that use different tools.

I suppose a list of projects I'd like to do might be useful here. Not that it'll make sense to anyone but me until the projects are up.
List of projects:
  ( ) Music scale practice tracker
  ( ) Preaching plan tool
